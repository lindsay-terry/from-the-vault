## Description
From-the-vault is my personal dev portfolio, showcasing some of my favorite projects to date, as well as a little bit about me, some ways to get in touch with me, and a downloadable resume.  This portfolio was built using React and the ChakraUI React Library, animations using framer-motion, and some icons from both reactIcons and FontAwesome.

## Usage
Click on the link to the deployed application to view my dev portfolio!  This is a single-page-application built using React and Chakra UI, and the root of the application is a component sharing a little bit about me.  A navigation menu at the top of the screen allows users to click to view my portfolio, which includes a custom carousel of some of my favorite projects to date, each with links to their github repositories and a live demo of the application, as well as a screenshot and a description.  I have a contact me component with details about how to get in touch with me, as well as a form to submit user information.  The last component showcases some of my most prominent skills as well as a button to download a copy of my resume.  Thank you for viewing, and enjoy!
